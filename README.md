# ReBuild
ReBuild is a set of scripts providing a common project model and build automation for complex modular software projects, based on GNU Make. The script framework is modular and extensible, making it easy to add new features and support new tools.

## Installation
ReBuild is designed to be integrated by including it into the project codebase as a git submodule. It is recommended that you create your own fork of the ReBuild git repo and include that into your project, as this gives you direct control over if and when your project receives updates to ReBuild from upstream.
